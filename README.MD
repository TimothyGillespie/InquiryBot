# Inquiry Bot

Sometimes you just need to inquire multiple times,

and as a programmer you always feel the urge to automate any task you encounter.

Ask someone for a file or some information and automatically ask them until they provide it via Telegram! Or until they think this
joke became more annoying than funny and just revoke the bots permission to send them messages.
